# find-git
(recursivly) find (list) git repos in your 'dev' folder, and list their remote status

Useful for things like finding local changes before changing department, pushing all changes before vacation and doing a 'backup' of all your repos (just because it's in git doesn't mean it's pushed to a remote).
